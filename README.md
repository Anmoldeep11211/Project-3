This game is a unique blend of chance and choice, involving two players who alternately take on roles based on the outcomes of their decisions and random elements. Here's a breakdown of the game:

Player Assignment: The game begins with two players, named Player 1 and Player 2. One of them is randomly assigned to be the "Odd Player," and the other becomes the "Even Player."

Initial Number Selection: The Odd Player starts by choosing a number between 1 to 10. The Even Player doesn't choose but is assigned a random number between 1 to 10.

Winner Determination: The sum of these two numbers determines the initial winner. If the sum is odd, the Odd Player wins the round; if it's even, the Even Player wins.

Toss Outcome and Role Selection: The winner of this initial round then decides whether to 'bat' or 'bowl.' This decision determines who will bat and who will bowl in the subsequent phase of the game.

Batting and Bowling Phase: The batting player selects a number between 1 to 10, and simultaneously, the bowling player is assigned a random number between 1 to 10. If the numbers match, the batting player is 'out.' If they don't match, the batting player's score increases by the number they chose.

Scoring and Role Reversal: After the batting player is out, their total score is noted. The roles are then reversed, and the second phase of the game begins with the players swapping roles. The new batting player's goal is to exceed the score set by the first batting player.

Winning the Game: The game concludes when the second batting player either surpasses the first player's score or gets out. The player with the higher score wins the game.
